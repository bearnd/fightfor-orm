    Description:


    This DTD defines the "baseline" of the health topic groups in MedlinePlus.  A 
    baseline of the health topic groups is a snapshot of all the health topic groups
    at one specific time. It does not record any changes of the health topic groups 
    in MedlinePlus (i.e. new, modified, or deleted topics).  
    
    ====================================================================================
    A sample XML data structure:
    
   <health-topic-groups total="88" total-english="44" total-spanish="44" date-generated="05/04/2012 01:11:24">
	<group language="English" id="1" url="https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/cancers.html">Cancers</group>
   </health-topic-groups>
    
    Note: 
    * Root element is health-topic-groups.
    * The health-topic-groups element can contain one or more group elements. 
    * The group element value will be stored in specific language (i.e. English or 
      Spanish) based on the language attribute value in the group element.
      
    Special DTD Notation:
    
    * = 0 or more occurrences (optional element and repeatable)
    ? = 0 or 1 occurrences (optional element at most 1)
    + = 1 or more occurrences (required element and repeatable)
    | = choice, one or the other but not both
